# Translator
This is the implementation of a Morse code translator using Python. The translator makes use of a programming language as a key and a simple algorithm of changing characters to dots and dash and vice versa. 

In this process of translation, when a character is given as input by translating it we get a morse code from the hashmaps as output. When Morse code is given as input then by translating it we get a character as output.

There are Six Files:
- dictionary.py: This file has dictionary having key and values for conversion. 
- encryption.py: It has code to encrypt data.
- decryption.py: It has code to decrypt data.
- gui.py: Used to run GUI.
- gui_support.py: It has try and except for importing right library.
- run.py: It deals with running of code.
